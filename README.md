# PSI CMS

This is a very old package dating back from the early 2000s. I found
it recently while browsing some old hard disk backups and thought to 
keep it on github for posterity.

It's a simple functional PHP based CMS and as I recall it was one of the first
things I wrote when I started dabbling with web development, long before
the days of OO programming and modern MVC frameworks. It gives a good idea
of how things were done back then and why they are not done the in same way
anymore.

This package is, of course, no longer maintained.

Original README file follows below:
