PSI CMS v. 0.3.1 installation instructions
__________________________________________

1. Unpack the archive
2. Copy the files to your web server
3. Point your browser to http://your_site/ and the installer will launch 
automatically
4. Follow the installation instructions (no need to create a DB in 
advance if you have root MySQL access; otherwise you'll be asked for a 
database name, user and password ).
5. Delete or rename the "install" folder after the installation 
completes to avoid losing your database data if the installer is 
accidentally re-run
