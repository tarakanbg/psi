PSI CMS CHANGELOG
_________________

New Features:
- Modular content and layout structure implemented - all elements on the 
page are now treated as modules, which can be activated, deactivated, 
edited, deleted and so on - all via the Staff Area. The entire web page 
is now divided in 14 zones and each module can be directed to show in a 
particular zone. Also modules can be given a scope - to be 
valid/displayed only on the title page, or only on inner pages, or 
everywhere. Additionaly modules in any zone can be given a position and 
ordered by position. The webmasters can also define as many custom HTML 
modules as needed to display additional content features, widgets, etc 
wherever they like on the page. This feature also makes templating very 
easy and with little efforts PSI CMS can now be adapted for any web 
template.
- Global settings management implemented - a number of settings, 
previously defined in the code as constants or variables are now stored 
in the database and can be accessed and edited via the admin interface 
in the Staff Area - e.g. the site name, site language, description, 
keywords.
- dynamic page title in browser - the title now represents the site title,
followed by the name of the selected subject, page, subpage. It's a
very useful feature for SEO.
- HTML descrption and keywords can now be added and edited separately
for each page/subpage, and they are dynamically sent to the browser
when a page/subpage is shown. Another nice feature for SEO.
- Image management added. Webmasters now can easily upload images via
the admin interface, and associate them with individual pages/subpages.
The images are stored in the database, not in the file system, and can be
easily reviewed, uploaded and deleted - all via the interface
- webmasters now can not only add, but also view, edit and delete
other administrators
- new field added for the admins - apart from their nickname they
can now add a full name
- last modification time/date of any page and subpage is now
automatically stored in the database and can be shown below the content
of a page/subpage in the public and staff area
- new fields added to the pages/subpages database tables - now the 
author and editor of a particular page are logged automatically and can 
be displayed below the content of the page in the public and staff area
- all subpages of a particular level now visible if another subpage
on the same level is selected
- different CSS sheets now implemented for the public site and the
staff area

Bugs Fixed:
- utf encoding now recognized and shown properly in IE


v. 0.3.1 (Amalthea)
--------------------------------

Bugfix Release

- 8 bugs fixed. Refer to https://bugs.launchpad.net/psicms/ for
full information

v. 0.3 (Amalthea)
-------------------------------
New Features:
- added subpages, thus enabling the user to effectively use 3 level 
navigation if needed (subjects, pages, subpages). Subpages are fully 
creatable,editable and deletable via the admin interface, as are the 
other two layers of content hierarchy
- introducing the concept of "torn pages". Torn pages are pieces of
content, that are not included or dependant on the main heirarchy scheme
(subjects, pages, subpages). They are individual separate items that can
be optionally included on the title page (implemented) or under menu tags
or in modules or included as a page/subpage to a particular subject
(not yet implemented).
- now it's possible for the webmaster to dynamicaly construct
the contents of the title page by using torn pages.
- added language pack support
- added Bulgarian and English language packs
- the default CSS template included is not anymore with fixed page 
height
- added dynamic prefix to DB table names to allow multiple installations 
in 1 database. The prefix is choosed during the installation.
- added two installer modes: first - webmasters may enter the root 
password for MySQL, if they have access to the root MySQL account, and 
let the installer create the database and the user for this database OR 
second: the webmaster may provide an existing database name and MySQL 
user credentials to make the installation in an already existing 
database (i.e. without root access)
- smart installer - if the installer finds an existing installation, it will
redirect to the main site without re-running. Vice verse if the installation
flag is set to "no", the main page will forward you to the installer. The
installation flag is stored in your "constants.php" file.
- GNU GPL integrated in the installer
- the current PSI CMS version number now displays dynamically wherever 
necessary, based on information stored atomatically during the 
install/upgrade process
- the current year now displays dynamically in the copyright sign in the 
footer of the page
- added link from the site title in the header to the main title 
page
- added PCI CMS link in the footer and encoded the footer

- smart and easy installer - just point your browser to the install 
folder and follow the instructions

- #173756 - No cyrillic support for the DB
